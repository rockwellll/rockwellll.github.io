                She was awake, aside from the lights that were piercing her eyelids in all directions she couldn't see anything else. Damn, where am I now? What have I put myself through this time? She thought. It was a dark area, with sparkles of light shining above her, bigger than a room she concluded after carefully looking around, there was no soul to be seen around, just the soul of loneliness in the air. She had no idea who she was, what her past had been. It was like all her memories were wiped out, like a house being swept by a hurricane. After a long time, she forgot how long, a voice cracked over, it seemed to be inhuman, soulless, angry, and was asking all kinds of questions, one after another. Who are you? What’s your name? Where are you from? The voice cried. She couldn’t say any word, not because she was afraid, but because she had realized that every memory she ever had, every feeling, loved one, friend, had all been gone, like a baby being born for the first time, it doesn't know anything and gradually learns in life, she realized that she was the baby.

                I don’t know, she replied. “Don’t lie to us heretic” the voice cried again, we are the legion, we know everything in existence, you cannot lie to us, you are an anomaly, unnatural being in existence, one that soon will be wiped out from it, like all your predecessors who have tried to crush the legion, but the legion will withstand the test of time, and all of you. Who the hell is the legion, she thought and what do they want with me. The voice broke off, silence dominated the air.

                She tried to turn her head around to examine the room, with great effort she was able to turn her head, because all of her body was securely and tightly strapped. On the left she was able to see a couple of iron chairs, they were covered in dust, it was obvious no one had sat on them for a long time, behind the chairs she could see a painting depicting a person on a chair, it was hanged on a wall, but she couldn’t see what the painting was and who was inside it. She tilted her head to the right, she could see another object, after careful looking she concluded that it’s an interrogation chair, like the one she’s strapped to, it was a tall object, black and slender, it was made of an ironish material, though she couldn't conduct which material it was. There were multiple straps on the object, to hold all parts of the body.

                A door broke open, and a guy came in. He was wearing a black attire, it had some elegant look into it. On the top it was a shirt and a jacket on top that covered the upper body, the pants looked comfortable to wear, and a black boot that completed the suit. The hat stood out the most, one of the edges was longer than the other, he was wearing a hat that had some weird symbol on it she thought. It was placed above the forehead. The guy talked first, he was more humane than the previous sound, he was treating her kindly, though not kind. He asked the same questions as the previous sound. What’s your name? Where are you from? He repeated. By this time she figured out what the symbol on the hat was, it was a three headed serpent, heads aligned in a manner that was imitating a pyramid like structure. One of the heads seemed to be growing back as it was smaller than the other two heads, perhaps it was cut off on purpose, she thought. The world she lived in , she remembered, had various symbols which had their own meaning, but she couldn’t decipher what it meant, she concluded. She could see his face more clearly, it was expressionless, his facial expressions adversited the fact that the man must be soulless as he was asking the questions, his eyes were pale blue, his cheeks were bony, he also had a scar. You better answer my questions or things will be bad for you. She said what she had thought earlier, I have no memory of who I am, I don’t know why I'm here, and what the so-called legion wants with me. The legion is an ever expanding empire, he said. We are on the offense to take on the whole world, and have done so currently. And other worlds are crumbling as we talk and breathe, the prophecy is true and we are serving the prophet. If you tell us the truth, you can walk away with your life. Those people are barbaric, brainless, sadistics, they will take you to the verge of death and back before making you submit to their will, telling the truth. Why are you with them, she replied, how can you be with an organization and not support their ideology. Silence you wench, he said with a loud voice this time while slapping her on the left check, then left the room

            <p class="text__primary w-11/12 lg:w-8/12 self-center">
                She had established that the legion was an empire that was on the march for the world, and were successful in their campaign. After some time, the door was opened again, this time two men came inside, one of them was carrying a bag of some kind, the bag was brown material and had the same three-headed serpent symbol on one of the sides, let’s hope i get through with whatever they intend to with me, she thought to herself, and like someone waiting on his deathbed, they know what’s coming, they know death will visit them soon but they still have a small amount of hope, that death delays their meeting, yet death does not quarrel with anyone, when the bottle is empty, death will be coming, she was like the person who was waiting on her deathbed, knowing something bad will happen, but still hoped it didn't. One of the men opened the box, she couldn’t look inside it. After some moments he had placed all his tools on a table near her, what she could see was three needle-like objects, their length was of a middle finger on an adult man. They had pointy and sharp heads, were structured like a pyramid, the bottom is fat and gradually becomes thinner as it goes up. You will wish you were dead, the other man cried. And so, she did not know what was happening, replied, i don't know anything about the legion, I'm not with any group that acts against the legion, I have no memory of who I was, let me go. We will soon know if you are telling the truth, heretic. Shall we, the punisher said. And so, they began torturing her. The punisher clearly was inhumane, he had unnatural force within him, one that’s not acquainted with humans, he placed one of the needles on the center of her forehead, and started pushing it against her. Slowly, the needle was kniving it’s way on her skull, she could feel it piercing her head, and so was screaming with pain, just as the needle was fully inside he stopped. Why are you doing this, what are you trying to gain by torturing me, this is the prophet’s way, he taught us this manner of working with anomalies, the other man stated. The needle is a holy object, blessed by the prophet, when placed properly inside one’s skull, will unlock any memories and force the subject to tell the fact that they are hiding, he finished. The punisher resumed his work, he was a craftsman, after digging the other two needles on her skull, one on each side, they stopped, there was blood everywhere, on her skull, on the punisher’s hands and on the floor. Let’s go, the other man stated, this place is monitored by our eyes and we will know of it when she speaks of her memories, and so both men went out of the room, closing the door behind them. She was screaming with pain, though she did not scream aloud, but rather tried to keep the screaming within her soul, she did not remember if she was tortured before losing her memories, or this was the first time. But, this time was the most painful that she had gone through, she was broken, she thought that she was alone, she did not belong to any group, country, kinsmen, for a moment she believed that she was an anomaly, she was truly alone, she thought. Slowly, not willingly she started fainting, she tried to stay awake, but it was impossible, she had been awake for a long time, and so her body decided that it needs to leave this world, and so she went to sleep, before fainting she thought, it cannot be true,not an anomaly, i belong to a group, have my own kinsmen, friends, it must be, has to be, she realized she was crying as she felt tears sliding across her cheeks.

                She woke up to the same two guys who punished her, they were acting hysterically, happy, it seemed that their method had worked, they were crying to the telescreen that was in the room, once again, we are lucky to see the prophet’s way being proven before us, there she is talking. She realized there were some words coming out of her mouth, unwillingly, like her mouth had a mind of its own. It first talked about a rebellion, stated that the rebellion is true, the false prophet will be dethroned and all people with him will face justice, the two punishers were stressed and started talking together, their faces seemed that they were afraid of what she way saying, and so they went out in stress. She did not know what the rebellion was, but the legion would not believe me, she thought to herself. She felt scared, her body shivering, she had briefly lost control of her body. 
            </p>

            <p class="text__primary w-11/12 lg:w-8/12 self-center">
                The person who was kind to her came back after a while. He informed her that if what she has stated before was true, what do you know about the rebellion, are you a member of it, this is not possible, the rebellion was crushed two years ago, he murmured to himself. What is the rebellion, she asked him. Alright, let’s assume you don’t know what the rebellion is. As with every story, when there is a man who does good, there will always be people who dislike the good man, no matter how many good deeds he has done, the dislikers will always scheme against him. And so it is, the rebellion was a group of heretic, godless people, they went about the world and spread false information about the legion, and it’s prophet. Stating that the prophet was a false one, and so news had reached the prophet, naturally he had become very angry with the rebellion, he had ordered to gather more information about them, who are they, where are they from. The serpent's group was founded, an elite division of the legion working tirelessly on finding information on the rebellion. The rebellion was good, they left no tracks behind when they had killed our people and destroyed the statues of our prophet, which had only made him angrier. After years of investigation we found that the rebellion belongs to a group of people who label themselves “Children of the mountains”. They belonged to the mountains, an area the legion had not yet seized, and did not intend to seize, because the legion concluded that it would take a huge amount of effort to reach the mountains, and so deemed it unnecessary since the people from the mountains could not pose any threat since they were outsiders. The group, consisting of various elite fighters, are people who label themselves as the rightful owners of the mountains, and the northern areas occupied in the legion empire. And so, the prophet ordered them to be killed and erased from the pages of history. As god tells something to be so it exists, the prophet ordered the annihilation of the group, and they were annihilated, every trace to them was killed and it was declared that the people of the mountains had been defeated and the light of the prophet had reached them. Or so, that’s what we thought, according to your words, the rebellion still exists, which means only there is a plan to kill the prophet.

            <p class="text__primary w-11/12 lg:w-8/12 self-center">
                Without further words, the man left the room. And so, she started thinking about the rebellion more, and the people from the mountains. Trying to scrape any leftover memories inside her head that had these words in them. It was becoming clear to herself that she was in a state of Amnesia, she had memories but could not remember them, it seemed that the her past self was acquainted or seen the legion, and after much thoughts and thinking this was the only information she could scrape, that she had forgotten memories about herself. I wonder, what do I look like?, she thought to herself.
